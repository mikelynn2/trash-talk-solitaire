## Description

**Finally, a card game that judges you.**

Trash Talk Solitaire is classic Klondike solitaire with a twist — a snarky British commentator who roasts your bad moves and reluctantly praises your good ones.

**Features:**
• Classic Klondike solitaire gameplay
• Witty AI commentary on every notable move
• British grandmother voice that's equal parts disappointed and proud
• Satisfying card sounds and haptic feedback
• Smooth animations and easy drag-and-drop
• Auto-complete when victory is in sight
• Beautiful green felt design

**Sample Commentary:**
• "Oh, burying that King? Bold strategy, let's see how that works out..."
• "That move was so bad, the cards are embarrassed for you."
• "Finally! A move that doesn't make me question your life choices."

No ads. No in-app purchases. Just you, 52 cards, and a voice that won't let you forget your mistakes.
