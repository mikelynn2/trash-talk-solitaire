## Description

**Finally, a card game that judges you.**

Trash Talk Solitaire is classic Klondike solitaire with a twist — a dry British butler who observes your every move with thinly veiled disappointment.

**Features:**
• Classic Klondike solitaire gameplay
• Witty AI commentary on every notable move
• Dry British butler voice — dignified, disapproving, devastating
• Satisfying card sounds and haptic feedback
• Smooth animations and easy drag-and-drop
• Auto-complete when victory is in sight
• Beautiful green felt design

**Sample Commentary:**
• "Burying a card, sir? A bold strategy. Bold, and inadvisable."
• "I have served many masters, sir. None have buried cards with such enthusiasm."
• "A sensible move. How refreshingly out of character."

No ads. No in-app purchases. Just you, 52 cards, and a voice that won't let you forget your mistakes.
